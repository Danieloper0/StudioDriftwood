# Studio DriftwoodÂ© by Daniel Ding 
A website handcrafted to showcase my array of talents like UI/UX Design, my hobbies, extracurriculars, and much more.
Currently I am in 8th grade, Middle School, and I started building this website during the dark quarantine times of 2020 as a small side project which I did not expect to turn out so great, and to also obviously outdue COVID-19.

Studio Driftwood is also built alongside tools like Gsap, React, Node, Webflow, and more for that professional look.

Greetings, from Daniel
